## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:

- **Provide context** - Mention part numbers, machine names, or processes
- **Ask follow-up questions** - Jarvis remembers your conversation
- **Use natural language** - Talk like you're asking a coworker

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Don't share sensitive customer data** (though it stays private, good practice)
- **Don't expect real-time machine data** (coming in future updates)
